# GalleryProject
React application built for the Comedy UO website. Backend users upload their photographs to Google Drive, which is connected to an S3 bucket. The Django back-end of the React app grabs these images from the bucket and feeds them into the front-end. User's are then able to download these pictures once they've put in their contact information.
